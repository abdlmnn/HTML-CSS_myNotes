I'm Mohammad Abdulmanan i hope this notes that i created might help for you especially for those who are beginners and starting to learn HTML and CSS.

My advice for you guys is read and understand all the explanation that i included of each HTML and CSS file.

  First read and understand the HTML - Abdulmanan file:
    Try doing it or encode it not just copying it and paste it, it won't help for you.
    You don't need to memorize it, you just need to practice it and you will familiarize it.
    So in HTML it has no CSS styling but more on focusing the structure of HTML. 
    You must learn and understand the basic elements or tags and attributes but some are not there you just need to explore it.
  
  Second once you are done learning HTML you can proceed to CSS - Abdulmanan file:
    What i said earlier try doing it and do not copy and paste.
    No need to memorize just familiarize it.
    Keep practicing.
